As an user, I want to use the system to track price from DragonLair/AlphaSpel/Sfbok

As an user, When I enter the homapge, I want to enter a keyword, and matching search items are displayed from various providers.
Then, I want to select one or more game to add to my tracking collection.
Or, I want to add the keyword to my tracking collection.

As an user, When I enter my collection page, I want to see all of my tracked items.
And, I want to see their price histories.

As an user, When I enter my collection page,
And click on one of the [-] buttons,
The selected item is removed from my collection.
